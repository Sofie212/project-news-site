# News Site

Ceate a newspaper site with focus on responsive design and flexbox.

## The problem

I used VS-code to created the html code (dislpay desktop) and made sure to add code to make the webpage responsive. In order to create the design I wanted, I stucturted the layout using CSS flex-box-model by dividing the code into boxes acting as parents and children. Added the responsive styling and layout for mobile and tablet version. To get a good overview I used LiveServer and DevTools to diagnos problems and coding errors and to make improvements. I also added some animation at the bottom om the webpage. 

If I had more time I would have elaborated more with the animation-part at teh bottom of the page and would have added an effect chancing images when hoovering over the big news picture.
